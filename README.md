# Employee Payroll Tracker Challenge-03

## Description

The reason for this project was to help me implement what I had learn with Javascript. From using while loops, if/ else if statements, and adding button attributes just to name a few.The use of this webpage is to help managers input all of their employees first names, last names, and salary. It'll then provide the manager with the employees average salarys and randomly select a winner for a drawing.
